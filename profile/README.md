reftool
===

Welcome! Feel free to check out our repositories.


# Goal

The goal of reftool (working title) is to build open source infrastructure to support research. Our initial project is a CLI tool, also named `reftool` which will streamline the process of packaging, versioning, DOIing and uploading files to various services such as Zenodo.

# Open Source

All of our tooling will be licensed under the permissive MIT license and our mission is to foster the growth of open source contributions to our software.

# Stay tuned!

This organization is new and we're at the early stages of getting started. Things may change drastically over time.

more coming soon...
